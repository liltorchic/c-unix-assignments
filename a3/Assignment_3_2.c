/*
Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem. A company
pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of
their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who grosses $3,000 in sales in a week
receives $200 plus 9% of $3,000, or a total of $470. Write a C program (using an array of counters)
that determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges
(assume that each salespersonâ€™s salary is truncated to an integer amount)*/
